# ml-drivers
A traffic simulator created in Unity with neural network-powered drivers

## Overview
This will be my Capstone project to finish my M.S. this semester. I'll post a more detailed description shortly. 

In a nutshell, this will be a Unity traffic simulator "game", in which the user can create, save, and load custom traffic scenes and observe neural network-powered drivers navigate them. I'll be using the Unity ML-Agents toolkit to train, test and neural network(s) that will manage the drivers.
